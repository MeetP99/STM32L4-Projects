Developed 4 projects using stm32l4kc. The projects were as follows

1. Morse Code: I had given a string as the input to the microcontroller and then programmed it in such a way that the corresponding morse Code was getting played on a speaker

2. Password Detector: In this project I tried to replicate a locker ie the locker opens only when we have given the correct password ,On similar lines when we input the correct string to the microcontroller a sound is played, if the password is correct then the corresponding LED glow that is red for incorrect password and green for incorrect password

 3. RGB LCD temperature sensor:
In this project, I had interfaced the MCP9700 temperature sensor with a stm32l4kc microcontroller in order to sensor the temperature and then print it on an LCD. Additionally using Pulse Width Modulation Technique I had connected 3 leds red, green  and blue and then was converting the temperature sensor using the MCP9700 into its corresponding color code automatically

4. ATM machine: I made an atm machine which is a state machine using stm32l4kc.Additionally, I programmed it in such a way that after the number of attempts passed the user can not enter any more passwords,ie they exit the state machine.
